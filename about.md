I grew up digital in Japan. While turning to physics and mathematics in high school and college, computers had never ceased to fascinate me. Circa 2000, when tech start-ups were ever so cool, I followed suit---dropped out of the college and started a business. As I developed resource management software for small-scale farmers and interacted with them, I found growing plants fascinating and much room for improving food systems. The idea of local food systems began to dawn on me. To test my hunch, I created an online service that delivered fresh produce to local people and facilitated interactions among them. I grew most vegetable by myself and directly communicated with consumers of the produce---firsthand experience of local food initiatives.

In 2010, being convinced of its potential and seeking systematic knowledge, I went to New Zealand to study agribusiness. However, as my interests drifted from entrepreneurship to teaching & research, I decided to pursue an academic career that, I believed, could make me more useful for society. In 2020, I earned my PhD and fortunately got a job at [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au), the University of Melbourne.

I enjoy cooking, motorcycling, and simple life in general.

I am competent in software design and coding. I like Python but also feel comfortable with others (e.g. R, Julia and C#). Aside from software engineering, I am trained in economics, machine learning, and statistics at graduate levels, and mathematics at an undergraduate level.
