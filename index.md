Hello, World! I am Yuji Saikai from Adelaide, Australia. I work for [School of Agriculture, Food & Wine](https://set.adelaide.edu.au/agriculture-food-wine/) at the University of Adelaide. I am really interested in computational approaches to complex real-world problems. My current research focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics, reinforcement learning, and their applications to agricultural systems.
