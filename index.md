where am I now?

Hello, world! My name is Yuji Saikai. I work for [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au) at the University of Melbourne. I love both teaching and research in Maths & Stats. So, it is exciting to be part of [Mathematics and Statistics Learning Centre](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/study/mslc) and [Melbourne Centre for Data Science](https://science.unimelb.edu.au/mcds). My research interest lies in data-driven optimisation and reinforcement learning as well as their applications to precision agriculture.

I am currently on Melbourne Early Career Academic Fellowships (MECAF) and will be in the job market in 2022-23.
