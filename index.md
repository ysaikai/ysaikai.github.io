Hello, World! I am Yuji Saikai from Melbourne, Australia. I work for [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au) at the University of Melbourne. I am really interested in computational approaches to complex real-world problems. My current research focuses on data-driven optimisation and its applications to precision agriculture.
