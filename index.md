Hello, World! I am Yuji Saikai from Melbourne, Australia. I work for [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au) at the University of Melbourne. I am really interested in computational approaches to complex real-world problems. My current research focuses on data-driven optimisation and its applications to precision agriculture.

I am currently on Melbourne Early Career Academic Fellowships (MECAF) and will be in the job market in 2023.
