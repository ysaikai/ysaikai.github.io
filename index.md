**Welcome to Yuji Saikai's website!**

I work for [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au) at the University of Melbourne. I love teaching and research in data science. So, it is exciting to be part of [Mathematics and Statistics Learning Centre](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/study/mslc) and [Melbourne Centre for Data Science](https://science.unimelb.edu.au/mcds). My research interests lie in data-driven optimization and reinforcement learning as well as their applications to precision agriculture.
