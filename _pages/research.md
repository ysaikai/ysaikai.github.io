I am interested in computational approaches for agriculture. In particular, my research focuses on applications of novel methods to agriculture, including machine learning, Bayesian optimization and complex systems, in order to answer the key questions better.

## A bandit algorithm for efficient on-farm research

Yuji Saikai and Paul D. Mitchell

Field experiment is the foundation for gaining agronomic insight into causal relationship between inputs and outputs and, based on them, optimizing cropping systems. When facilitated by precision agriculture, individual farmers may benefit from experimenting with new inputs and practices on their own heterogeneous fields. However, on-farm experiment is different from dedicated research activities in universities or corporations as it is often constrained by limited resources, requiring even higher efficiency, and needs to be incorporated into day-to-day operations, making a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address it, we develop an algorithm based on suitable machine learning techniques: active learning, multi-armed bandit, and Thompson sampling. Then, we demonstrate its advantage against the conventional practice using simulation built on the existing field trial data. Our algorithm uniformly outperforms it, and the efficiency gain could be substantial. In addition, the generality of our algorithm makes itself applicable to a wide range of similar problems.

## An agent-based model of insect resistance management and mitigation for Bt maize: A social science perspective

Yuji Saikai & Paul D. Mitchell

It is natural to see insect resistance management as a complex system in which there are spatial-temporal interaction between many biological and social factors. Therefore, we build an agent-based model and conduct simulation experiments to provide insights into the complex system and inform policymakers of potential options. Specifically, we emphasize the significance of social factors, e.g. economic incentives and social network, which have been neglected in the literature. The results suggest that we are in a critical situation where the resistance to Bt crop is about to serge and immediate actions should be taken. In accordance with our intuitions, proactive measures such as refuge requirement and tax are more efficient in terms of economic surplus than reactive ones such as ban and spray.
